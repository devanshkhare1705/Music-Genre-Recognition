# Music-Genre-Recognition

This project focuses on developing and evaluating deep learning methods to classify musical pieces into appropriate genres. My team and I chose to work on this project as part of our APS360: Applied Deep Learning course at University of Toronto. 

Please read the 'Project Report.pdf' file first; it details the project context, background research, data processing, different approaches used, evaluation of approaches, and methods of improvement. The code for this project can then be found in the 'Music Genre Recognition v1.0.ipynb' file. Lastly, my individual contributions in the project can be tracked through the 'Contribution Report.pdf' file.
